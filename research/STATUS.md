## Objective

Prepare a defensible graduate thesis proposal on evolutionary computation applied to AI agents, aiming for 2–3 connected innovation points and 2–3 small-paper submissions.

## Confirmed requirements

- The immediate milestone is the thesis proposal/opening report.
- The thesis should be built around 2–3 substantive, connected contributions.
- Each contribution should have a plausible path to an independently publishable paper.
- The research should use evolutionary computation as a central method.
- Related work may be borrowed and improved; novelty does not require being completely unrelated to prior work.
- Existing work must be examined carefully before accepting or rejecting an idea.
- This project must be resumable across new ChatGPT conversations using repository records.
- Do not import candidate directions or conclusions from unrelated projects or previous conversations.

## Not yet decided

- Exact research question and title.
- Whether the central object is a single-agent component, a multi-agent system, an evolutionary search mechanism, or another agent capability.
- Whether RSI is in scope for the final proposal.
- Candidate evolutionary algorithm(s), representation, base model, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics.
- Which papers or codebases will be the primary baselines.
- Final 2–3 innovation points and their mapping to papers.

## Research completed so far

- Initialized project charter, literature protocol, thesis–paper map, decision log, and session handoff.
- Performed a first-pass search across recent agent/EA papers and surveys.
- Registered a preliminary matrix of 15 papers or closely related works in research/RELATED_WORK_MATRIX.md.
- Wrote research/INITIAL_RESEARCH_MEMO.md to capture what is already crowded and which candidate questions require deeper auditing.
- Confirmed that broad claims about prompt evolution, multi-agent generation, modular agent search, workflow evolution, whole-agent configuration tuning, memory evolution, and cost-aware optimization have substantial prior art.

## Evidence state and caveats

This is a **first-pass map**, not a systematic review and not a novelty assessment. Some papers have been read at abstract/method/results level; not every paper, supplement, or codebase has been fully audited. Candidate research questions remain hypotheses. No innovation point is approved.

## Latest scope adjustment (2026-10-23)

The user considers finite-budget evaluation efficiency insufficiently compelling as the central thesis problem. Therefore:
- Do **not** promote evaluation-budget allocation, noisy-fitness estimation, or survivor selection under limited evaluation budget as the default thesis direction.
- Evaluation cost may remain a secondary constraint/metric when relevant, but must not drive topic selection merely because it is measurable.
- Refocus the next search on important agent capability/behavior limitations where evolutionary computation could enable a substantive improvement, while remaining open to borrowing and improving existing methods.
- Do not treat this scope adjustment as a rejection of all work on evaluation reliability; retain it as supporting background only if a stronger problem requires it.

## Next actions (ordered)

1. Deep-audit the current core papers (AgentSquare, AFlow, GEPA, ARTEMIS, HFlow, MemEvolve) to understand what capabilities and mechanisms they already improve—not just their evaluation costs.
2. Extract concrete agent failure modes and limitations from papers, supplements, benchmarks, and official code.
3. Broaden the search to evolutionary computation methods that improve substantive agent behavior/capability (e.g. planning, tool use, long-horizon reliability, adaptation/generalization, coordination, credit assignment, or other evidence-backed areas); do not preselect among these categories.
4. For each candidate problem, identify the strongest borrowable baseline and a specific improvement hypothesis; compare it against the closest work and traditional EC literature.
5. Rank candidate research questions by importance, novelty potential, methodological depth, feasibility, and ability to support 2–3 connected but independently defensible papers.
6. Select a provisional umbrella problem only after this comparison.
7. Draft the proposal: background, problem, related work, research questions, proposed method, innovation points, experiments, schedule, risks, and expected outcomes.

## Definition of done for the next milestone

The literature-scouting milestone is complete only when there is:
- a cited and verifiable set of relevant papers;
- a taxonomy and comparison matrix;
- deep analyses of the closest prior work;
- a ranked shortlist with explicit uncertainty and reasons;
- a recommended provisional direction with a falsifiable research question;
- no unsupported claims that the direction is novel.

## Update protocol

At the end of every meaningful research session, update this file with what was verified, files and sources added, decisions made and why, unresolved questions, the next concrete action, and the relevant commit SHA when available.
